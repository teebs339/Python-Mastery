Here's the plan for this repo. If anyone wants to connect, learn together or form a small newbie's community, feel free to leave a message to become a contributor.

Main goal for this repo is to learn Data Science (Machine Learning) and become master at it.

At the time of writing this, I have 2+ years of experience working as an automation engineer using VB.NET & tools like UiPath. I know how to "use" all models but don't know how to develop it. Which is the main reason im starting python from scratch.


## Ideal roadmap

1) Learning Python
   * Basic python scripting practices including Lists, Dictionaries, Looping, etc
   * Functions and classes
   * Starting to code in Jupyter Notebook environment

2) Pandas
   * Basic data analysis using Pandas
   * Overall getting hands on experience on Pandas library which includes Numpy
   * Concepts of arrays, spreadsheet in python, working with SQLs (where, joins, etc), Plotting (if available)

3) Data Analysis Projects
   * Find some sort of dataset. Get it from kaggle, some public website, bank data, games data.
   * Import Pandas and clean/analyze like you do in sheets
   * Maybe try plotting using some other library

4) ML Chapter 1: Maths
   * Statistics & Probability from here: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability
   * Linear Algebra from here: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra
   * Calculus/derivatives from here: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus
   * P.S. I'm not gonna nerd on these because i have already studied these in my degree before but if you're new to it, learning these might be helpful.

5) ML Chapter 2: Concepts
   * Simple algorithm    * Generic Algorithm
   * Linear & Logistic regression
   * Decision trees
   * Gradient boosting

6) Scikit Algorithms
   * Go to scikit webpage and learn from documentations. Or just search on yt and start.

7) ML Projects
   * Finally start working on ML projects or start watching toturials on it. By the time you reach this step, your python skills would be in the top 10% i assume. Search on yt and just start

8) Optional: Deep learning / CNN / Neural Network / NLP
   * Not recommended to be bother by this unless you're looking for a job in these.



Note: I know that even though the world is moving towards low -code/no -code, I still want to perfect my scripting skills. I can do almost anything using uipath and i have mastered it to a degree that I'm very comfortable with it but booting it up, loading all the dependencies, adding activities, opening sidepanels to change datatypes is really slow. I want to be able to do all this in python instantly and be confortable with it so thatswhy i choose the most difficult thing you can do in python (i assume).
